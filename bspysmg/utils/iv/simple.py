        Initializes the driver for which IV curve is to be plotted. It uses a config dict to
        initialize the driver. The driver can be the DNPU device itself (on chip training) or
        a surrogate model (off chip training). This class only allows for measurement of IV
        curves of one device at a time.

        Parameters
        ----------
        configs : dict
            ivcurve configurations with the following keys:

            - processor_type:  str
                The type of driver for which ivcurve is to be measured. It can take following
                values:
                    - cdaq_to_cdaq

        Computes the IV response of DNPU device or surrogate model to an input sawtooth signal.
        Optionally shows the graph on screen and saves it to current directory. This is done
        to check if a particular electrode has non linear IV response or a negative differential
        resistance (NDR).

        Parameters
        ----------
            v_max : float
                Maximum voltage that the sawtooth will achieve.
            v_min : float
                Minimum voltage that the sawtooth will achieve.
            point_no : int
                Number of points that the sawtooth will have.
            input_electrode : int
                Electrode number.
            up_direction : bool [Optional]
                Direction of the sawtooth. If true, the sawtooth will go first up and then down.
                If False, the sawtooth will go first down and then up. By default False.
            close : bool [Optional]
                If set to true, it closes the driver and clears it from memory.
            show_plot : bool [Optional]
                If set to true, it displays the generated plot.
            save_plot : bool [Optional]
                If set to true, it saves the generated plot to current directory.
